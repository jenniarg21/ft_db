Command line interface database management system created in C

This was a two-week, two-person team project to create a command line interface database management system in C. My team decided to base our database structure on the NoSQL graph database type since we weren’t familiar with it and wanted to take this opportunity to learn more about it.

Our management system provided the end-user with prompts and used standard input to allow creation, modification, and deletions. The data is stored within a file and is structured in a JSON-based format--this allowed for the fluidity of a node’s data structure.

## How To Use
To run this program:
1) Run the Makefile to compile the executable
```
make
```
2) Run the executable
```
./a_database
```
